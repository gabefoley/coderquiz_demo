    "\n",
    "### The questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's keep things fairly simple, and just have two questions, a Python file upload, and an image upload. This will cover the broad range of what Coder Quiz can handle, but we'll point out what other options are available at appropriate times too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say we want a quiz like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q1: Enter the third month of the year\n",
    "Q2: Enter a number between 200 and 400 (inclusive)\n",
    "Q3: Upload a Python file with a function of your choice in it\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a new form - Coder Quiz has three .py files where it stores forms - `forms_scie2100.py`, `forms_biol3014.py`, and `forms.py` . The first two are specifically for the two University of Queensland Bioinformatics courses, and the second is a general forms file that stores items such as the Practice Quiz, the Signup form, and the forms we use to query student's grades. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To keep things simple lets start a whole new file - `forms_example.py`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This will mean we have to import a few things, that we won't have to if we're adding a new form to an existing file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Add the following imports -\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    from flask_wtf import FlaskForm\n",
    "    from wtforms import StringField, SubmitField, FileField\n",
    "    from wtforms.validators import DataRequired\n",
    "    from form_validators import CorrectAnswer, CheckNumberRange\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Coder Quiz is written in the Python webframework Flask, and we use the WTForms library to create the interactive forms. flask_wtf is a module that lets you use WTForms in Flask. Flask is by design like this - pretty bare bones, and with lots of optional modules you can add onto it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The *first import line* imports the FlaskForm object, which are what our forms are going to be, the *second import line* imports some field types that we'll use when building our form, and the *third import line* imports some pre-existing validators for our forms. Not that these are all external modules to Coder Quiz, i.e. if you're interested there are a lot more types of fields, and default validators that you could utilise. The great thing about the validators is that we can write custom validators for our form, which is where a lot of the power in Coder Quiz comes from. This is what the *fourth import line* is importing - custom validators, including two that exist already - `CorrectAnswer` and `CheckNumberRange`\n",

    "There are two main private methods that a custom validator has, `__init__` and `__call__` .\n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__` is used to setup any of the data we'll need for validation - it can take arguments and set them as attributes, so that we can reuse the same validator but pass in the expected answer, or Python objects to generate the expected answer. Note that not all custom validators need an `__init__` method - `CheckPalindrome` for example doesn't need to take any arguments or do any setting up in order to tell if a string is a palindrome, but for the most part it's important to reusability to have an `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__call__` is the method that will be called when the user either checks or submits the form, and does the actual validation of the field. It has to take the arguments `self, form, field` because it is overriding an existing method, and we can use `field.data` to get access to the value that the user has entered as input to the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one basic workflow is to pass in a correct answer when constructing the validator, then when the user checks or submits we take their data from `field.data` and check to see if it is equivelant to the expected answer. If it passes whatever test we need it to, we can just return, but if it doesn't validate correctly then we need to raise a `ValidationError()` - and we can pass in whatever error message we want to display to the user on the rendered form. This means that we can easily display different error messages to the user after evalutating their code."
